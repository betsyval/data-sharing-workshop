## Share data

Before sharing the data, make sure to:
> ## to be checked
> check your ethical forms (if research on human participants, did the participant agreed on their data being publicly shared?
> include a README file with all the metadata (e.g., explanation of variables)
> remove sensible data that cannot be shared (name, age, etc.)
{: .checklist}


When you are ready to share the data, you will need to navigate the OSF project and give it an open license.
CC-BY 4.0 is a good license to use - people are free to reuse the contents provided that they acknowledge that they got it from you.


Now we have provided a license, let's make this component public.
